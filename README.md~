Welcome in Dice Game!


The project has been created by students in Kristianstad university in Sweden.

Bellow is the steps, and setup you need to follow all features.

To be able to try all feature, it is preferred to create Virtual Environment.

In your current directory enter the equivalent command line according to your operating system:

To create venv:

	To activate it write:	‘. .venv(bin/activate’	
	To deactivate it:	        ‘deactivate



Python .m venv env     If you are on windows
       
       To activate it write:	‘. .venv(bin/activate’
